# 3DFin
This repository contains additional files representing some of the work done for my master thesis.

3Dmodelingandprinting.docx file contains simple instructions on how to learn 3D modeling and printing, with referral to resources intended to make learning easier. The intention is that another student should be able to pick up the work from where I have left it. 

main/3Dmodels contains all the finalized 3D models of the fin rays in .f3d file formats. To view and modify this after download, one should have Autodesk Fusion 360 installed on your computer.
